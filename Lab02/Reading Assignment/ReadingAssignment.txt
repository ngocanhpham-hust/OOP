1. Reading assignment: When should accessor methods be used?
- According to the article, accessor methods (or getters and setter method) should be used carefully instead of blindly programming because accessors can violate the encapsulation principle. Developers should consider which variable should be exposed, which should be private. In general, the accessor method should only used for instance variables that need to be read and modified by clients.
